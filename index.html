        <h2>Web Application Security</h2>
        <p>
          Web application security services are basically about protecting
          assets. Assets can be a web page or customer database or they can be
          even a company’s reputation. Security is mainly concerned about
          understanding the threat. By analysing the applications one can
          identify potential threats and understand that each threat presents a
          degree of risk. Web application security services are about
          controlling risk and implementing effective measures. These services
          are the techniques of protecting networks and data from attacks or
          unauthorized access that are intended for exploitation. With the
          growing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks, ongoing attention
          is required to protect sensitive business and personal information, as
          well as safeguard data security.

        <h2>How can you build a secure web application?</h2>

        <p>
          Web security is important because a significant portion of that data
          can be sensitive information, whether that be personal information,
          financial data, intellectual property, or other types of data for
          which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative
          consequences. It is not possible to design and build a secure web
          application until you know your threats. The foundation of security
          includes authentication, authorisation, auditing, confidentiality,
          integrity and availability. The most difficult challenge in web
          security is the ever-evolving nature of security risks themselves.
          Today, the simple approach is insufficient, as the threats advance and
          change more quickly than organisations can keep up with. As a result,
          many organisations promote more proactive and adaptive approaches to
          web security.

        <h2>Challenges of web application security services</h2>

        <p>
          Web security services include identifying your organization’s security
          issues or the most valuable information requiring protection,
          Identifying the threats and risks facing that information, and
          outlining the damage your organization would face. The risk evaluation
          should also consider the issues that impact the way your company
          collects, storing and secures data. One of the most problematic
          elements of web security is the quickly and constantly evolving nature
          of security risks. The current environment requires the sufficient
          approach to protect against the dangerous risks.
